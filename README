kug-tools - Handful of utilities for handling Knytt Underground World.bin file
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, the utilities are very simple and may output a lot of excess information, but they seem to work.

lskug - list files in a world file
exkug - extract files from a world file to a directory
pkkug - package files from a directory in to a world file
geokug - visually display occupied screen in a world directory

lskug
-----

USAGE:
lskug <filename>

Print a list of files contained within filename.

Example Output:
0: Tiles @10
1: Sprites @1072
2: Script @2000
...

exkug
-----

USAGE:
exkug <filename>

Extract all files from filename and write each to a directory whose name is determined by removing the file 
extension from the filename.  Status is displayed for progress.

TODO: Currently the filename must have an extension otherwise it'll fail to create the directory.

pkkug
-----

USAGE:
pkkug <pathname>

Take all files in pathname and package them in to pathname.bin.  If the file exists, it'll be overwritten.

geokug
------

USAGE:
geokug <pathname>

Scan a world directory and display visually which screens are occupied, indicated with a # for occupied or a 
space for empty.  This only works for the "default" naming method ("x,y ...").  If a world is constructed 
differently, this tool won't work.

Example Output:
Dimensions:  X: 0 - 5  Y: 0 - 2
# ####
## ###
 ### #
